# Siddh Mandirwala — Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4. Features smooth animations, dark/light theme support, and a fully responsive design across all devices.

**But here's the twist** — this isn't your typical portfolio. There's an AI chatbot sitting in the corner that knows everything about me. Go ahead, ask it anything about my experience, projects, or skills. It's powered by Google's **Gemma 3 4B** model and will *only* answer questions about me (nice try though, if you were planning to ask it for homework help).
